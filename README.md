# Monitoring-IEC-changes-2015-

The application for International Experience Canada (IEC) 2015 program's process to monitor. This code checks the official website of IEC 2015 and sends the information to specified emails and/or phone numbers in case something changed. Changes are also being logged to the server.

Quite simple, but in some cases enormously useful code. For example, quite useful in the case you want to successfully apply to the program running on a first come, first accepted basis.

By the way, as I know, the basis "first come, first accepted" was changed in IEC 2016 and I think I know why - because it was impossible to get in to the IEC 2015 for those who delayed 2+ minutes from the exact moment the program has been opened to. Crazy game, but this code helped a lot in playing it.
